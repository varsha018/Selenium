	 * 1 -selenium IDE : record and play 2 -selenium RC 3 -selenium webdriver ..
	 * version : 4.x 4 -selenium grid

	 * main competitor of selenium is QTP..license tool..paid tool ..provided by HP
	 * .. quite expensive only supports one language>> VB script runs only on
	 * WINDOWS 2 or 3 browsers only now gone from market
	 * 
	 * 
	 * we migrated from json wire to w3c protocol..
	 * 
	 * Selenium 3 -uses JSON Wire Protocol while interacting with web browsers
	 * 
	 * Selenium 4 - uses W3C(World Wide Web Consortium)Webdriver protocol to
	 * interact with browsers now.. the drivers(servers) while launching their
	 * respective browsers were already using W3C protocol but selenium while
	 * interactive with these browser was using JSON wire protocol.. - since both of
	 * these are using the same protocol now..it is highly optimized.. it is
	 * following W3C standards.. which should be the proper standard.. it is
	 * stable.test cases will be more stable. common code for different browsers
	 * deprecated/added some APIs/Methods
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * bfore selenium 3.8 --->JSON WIRE PROTOCOL With and
	 * 3.8->3.14 ---> JSON + W3C protocol 
	 * After selenium 3.8 --->W3C webdriver protocol
	 * after 4.0 --> only w3c
