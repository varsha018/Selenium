
stale:something not fresh

staleElement : something gone from the page, Selenium cannot interact with objects which are not available not page, 
maybe element is not visible on the page,maybe page got refreshed.. xpath is absolutly fine,but element not visible.


we have some components which are AJAX calls: Asynchronous java script XML calls
some product info, some images

during booking flight tickets: sometimes only price section gets refreshed, sometimes some images are refreshed..so these are AJAX components.
								whole page does not gets refreshed, only these AJAX components/calls get refreshed.
								
when you locate a webElement >>> a unique identifier ID/dynamic ID is assigned (ID 1: 12122323242542-1)>>> (this ID gets expired)
									when you refresh the page, that ID changes(ID 1: 1212232324282-1)
							 >>> and you get StaleElement Exception
							 >> You never refersh the entire page, but that component got refreshed..id changes
							 >>so we get stale element>>AJAX component got refreshed.
							 
Never refresh your page..

how to overcome:  use implicit and explicit wait.
